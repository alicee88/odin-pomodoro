# Pomodoro Timer

An Odin Project project to practice HTML/JS/CSS skills.

A [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer app that sets work intervals (typically 25 minutes), separated by a break (typically 5 minutes).

Features include:
* Custom timer settings
* Tracking accumulated work intervals followed by a longer break time

Whilst the functionality of the timer functions was quite straightforward, getting a good design layout was challenging. I paired with a UX designer to help with the flow and structure of the app, iterating through several designs until we found one that worked well. 

I found [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) very helpful for choosing colour palates.
